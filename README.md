# Java File Master (JFM)

Java File Master (JFM) is a modular desktop application written in Java that acts as a **universal file opener**. Depending on the selected file type, JFM automatically launches the appropriate internal module (application) to handle and edit the file.

The goal of JFM is to provide a **single, extensible platform** for working with many different file types instead of using separate programs.
